        <p class="presentation">Hello! I'm Lidia, a recent graduate in UX Design with a fervent passion for the world of front-end. With a freshly earned degree in technology, I find myself at an exciting moment in my career, ready to explore the realms of user experience and interactive design.</p>
        <p>During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the complex and fascinating world of UX Design, where I discovered my passion for creating engaging and intuitive digital experiences. I became passionate about how design can influence and improve people's lives, and how front-end development can bring these visions to life.</p>
        <p>My interest in front-end stems from my desire to bring ideas from concept to digital reality. With skills in HTML, CSS, I enjoy turning design challenges into interactive and functional solutions. I am always seeking new ways to improve my technical and artistic abilities, and to create digital experiences that captivate the imagination and inspire action.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to take on new challenges and contribute to the world of design and digital development with my creativity and commitment. If you have an interesting project or want to collaborate on something extraordinary, don't hesitate to contact me. I'm ready to get to work and create something amazing together!</p>
